<title>SPHERICAL SEGMENT FORMULA</title>

<p><strong>SPHERICAL SEGMENT FORMULA:</strong><br />
<br />
If we cut a basketball with a pair of two knives parallely, then the solid that 
is defined by the cutting is the spherical segment. <br />
<br />
You can say that the spherical cap has been truncated, and so it can be called 
as a spherical frustum.<br />
<br />
Those spherical segment is called spherical zone, where we exclude the bases.<br />
<br />
The formula that we use here are volume and surface area:<br />
<br />
A=2πRh</p>

V=πh/6(3r1^2+r2^2+h2)</p>
